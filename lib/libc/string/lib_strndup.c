 * Name: strndup
 *
 * Description:
 *   The strndup() function is equivalent to the strdup() function,
 *   duplicating the provided 's' in a new block of memory allocated as
 *   if by using malloc(), with the exception being that strndup() copies
 *   at most 'size' plus one bytes into the newly allocated memory,
 *   terminating the new string with a NUL character. If the length of 's'
 *   is larger than 'size', only 'size' bytes will be duplicated. If
 *   'size' is larger than the length of 's', all bytes in s will be
 *   copied into the new memory buffer, including the terminating NUL
 *   character. The newly created string will always be properly
 *   terminated.
 *
