* Table

Callbacks from lwnl layer need to pass to user callback. A following table shows how lwnl callback convert to user callback. Some of members in wifi_manager_cb_msg_s which is passed by a user callback function are used to user callback function. Other members in structure are set to uninitialized state(eg. res to WIFI_MANAGER_SUCCESS, reason to 0 bssid to {0,} scanlist to NULL). So an application can check whether member is valid or not.
