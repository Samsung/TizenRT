config TESTING_SMP
	tristate "SMP example"
	default n
	depends on SMP
	---help---
		Enable the SMP example.  This example basically extracts the pthread
		barrier test from apps/testing/ostest and adds some instrumentation
		useful for debugging SMP implementations.

if TESTING_SMP

config TESTING_SMP_NBARRIER_THREADS
	int "Number of barrier threads"
	default 8
	---help---
		Specifies the number of threads to create in the SMP test.  The default
		is 8 but a smaller number may be needed on systems without sufficient memory
		to start so many threads.

config SMP_TEST_PTHREAD
	bool "Test SMP with Pthreads"
	default y
	---help---
		Test smp functionality using pthreads if this is enabled. Else, test the
		smp functionality with tasks.
