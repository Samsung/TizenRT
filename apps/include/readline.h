 * Name: readline
 *
 *   readline() reads in at most one less than 'buflen' characters from
 *   'instream' and stores them into the buffer pointed to by 'buf'.
 *   Characters are echoed on 'outstream'.  Reading stops after an EOF or a
 *   newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer.  A null
 *   terminator is stored after the last character in the buffer.
 *
 *   This version of realine assumes that we are reading and writing to
 *   a VT100 console.  This will not work well if 'instream' or 'outstream'
 *   corresponds to a raw byte steam.
 *
 *   This function is inspired by the GNU readline but is an entirely
 *   different creature.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   buf       - The user allocated buffer to be filled.
 *   buflen    - the size of the buffer.
 *   instream  - The stream to read characters from
 *   outstream - The stream to each characters to.
 *
 * Returned values:
 *   On success, the (positive) number of bytes transferred is returned.
 *   EOF is returned to indicate either an end of file condition or a
 *   failure.
