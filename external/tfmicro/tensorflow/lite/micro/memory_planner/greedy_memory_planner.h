// A memory planner that uses a greedy algorithm to arrange buffers in memory
// to minimize the overall arena size needed.
//
// The algorithm works like this:
//  - The client enters the buffer information through AddBuffer().
//  - When a function like GetOffsetForBuffer() is called, the
//    CalculateOffsetsIfNeeded() method is invoked.
//  - If an up to date plan is not already present, one will be calculated.
//  - The buffers are sorted in descending order of size.
//  - The largest buffer is placed at offset zero.
//  - The rest of the buffers are looped through in descending size order.
//  - The other buffers that need to be in memory at the same time are found.
//  - The first gap between simultaneously active buffers that the current
//    buffer fits into will be used.
//  - If no large-enough gap is found, the current buffer is placed after the
//    last buffer that's simultaneously active.
//  - This continues until all buffers are placed, and the offsets stored.
//
// This is not guaranteed to produce the best placement, since that's an
// NP-Complete problem, but in practice it should produce one that's decent.
