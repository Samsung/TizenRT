/***************************************************
 * Important note
 *
 * The following functions that deal with network operations will return
 * MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, but this does not mean that the operation has
 * taken place. An attempt will be made to write the network data, but if the
 * socket is not available for writing at that time then the packet will not be
 * sent. To ensure the packet is sent, call mosquitto_loop() (which must also
 * be called to process incoming network data).
 * This is especially important when disconnecting a client that has a will. If
 * the broker does not receive the DISCONNECT command, it will assume that the
 * client has disconnected unexpectedly and send the will.

 * Function: mosquitto_connect_bind_async
 *
 * Connect to an MQTT broker. This is a non-blocking call. If you use

 * This extends the functionality of <mosquitto_connect_async> by adding the

 * communication over a particular interface.
 *
 * May be called before or after <mosquitto_loop_start>.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * 	mosq -         a valid mosquitto instance.
 * 	host -         the hostname or ip address of the broker to connect to.
 * 	port -         the network port to connect to. Usually 1883.
 * 	keepalive -    the number of seconds after which the broker should send a PING
 *                 message to the client if no other messages have been exchanged
 *                 in that time.
 *  bind_address - the hostname or ip address of the local network interface to
 *                 bind to. If you do not want to bind to a specific interface,
 *                 set this to NULL.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS - on success.
 * 	MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -   if the input parameters were invalid, which could be any of:

 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_SSL_CTX - Pass an openssl SSL_CTX to be used when creating

 *	          This must be called before connecting to have any effect.
 *	          If you use this option, the onus is on you to ensure that

 *	option - the option to set.
 *	value -  the option specific value.
 *
 * Options:
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TCP_NODELAY - Set to 1 to disable Nagle's algorithm on client

 *	          messages at the potential cost of increasing the number of
 *	          packets being sent.

 *	MOSQ_OPT_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM - Value can be set between 1 and 65535 inclusive,

 *	          will override this option. Using this option is the recommended
 *	          method however.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_SEND_MAXIMUM - Value can be set between 1 and 65535 inclusive,

 *	          messages that this client will attempt to have "in flight" at

 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_OCSP_REQUIRED - Set whether OCSP checking on TLS
 *	          connections is required. Set to 1 to enable checking,
 *	          or 0 (the default) for no checking.
 *
 *	MOSQ_OPT_TLS_USE_OS_CERTS - Set to 1 to instruct the client to load and

 *
 * Define the Certificate Authority certificates to be trusted (ie. the server
 * certificate must be signed with one of these certificates) using cafile.
 *
 * If the server you are connecting to requires clients to provide a
 * certificate, define certfile and keyfile with your client certificate and
 * private key. If your private key is encrypted, provide a password callback
 * function or you will have to enter the password at the command line.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  mosq -        a valid mosquitto instance.
 *  cafile -      path to a file containing the PEM encoded trusted CA
 *                certificate files. Either cafile or capath must not be NULL.
 *  capath -      path to a directory containing the PEM encoded trusted CA
 *                certificate files. See mosquitto.conf for more details on
 *                configuring this directory. Either cafile or capath must not
 *                be NULL.
 *  certfile -    path to a file containing the PEM encoded certificate file
 *                for this client. If NULL, keyfile must also be NULL and no
 *                client certificate will be used.
 *  keyfile -     path to a file containing the PEM encoded private key for
 *                this client. If NULL, certfile must also be NULL and no
 *                client certificate will be used.
 *  pw_callback - if keyfile is encrypted, set pw_callback to allow your client
 *                to pass the correct password for decryption. If set to NULL,
 *                the password must be entered on the command line.
 *                Your callback must write the password into "buf", which is
 *                "size" bytes long. The return value must be the length of the

/*
 * Function: mosquitto_property_read_byte
 *
 * Attempt to read a byte property matching an identifier, from a property list
 * or single property. This function can search for multiple entries of the
 * same identifier by using the returned value and skip_first. Note however
 * that it is forbidden for most properties to be duplicated.
 *
 * If the property is not found, *value will not be modified, so it is safe to
 * pass a variable with a default value to be potentially overwritten:
 *
 * (start code)
 * uint16_t keepalive = 60; // default value
 * // Get value from property list, or keep default if not found.
 * mosquitto_property_read_int16(proplist, MQTT_PROP_SERVER_KEEP_ALIVE, &keepalive, false);
 * (end)
 *
 * Parameters:
 *	proplist - mosquitto_property pointer, the list of properties or single property
 *	identifier - property identifier (e.g. MQTT_PROP_PAYLOAD_FORMAT_INDICATOR)
 *	value - pointer to store the value, or NULL if the value is not required.
 *	skip_first - boolean that indicates whether the first item in the list
 *	             should be ignored or not. Should usually be set to false.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	A valid property pointer if the property is found
 *	NULL, if the property is not found, or proplist is NULL.
 *
 * Example:
 * (start code)
 *	// proplist is obtained from a callback
 *	mosquitto_property *prop;
 *	prop = mosquitto_property_read_byte(proplist, identifier, &value, false);
 *	while(prop){
