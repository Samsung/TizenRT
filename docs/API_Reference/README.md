# API Reference

There are two types of API references, libs & env and public.  
Extract zipped files, libs_env.tar.gz and public.tar.gz.
```
tar -xvzf libs_env.tar.gz
tar -xvzf public.tar.gz
```

These two topics are splitted temporarily and will be reorganized.

## Libs & Env

The libs & env has kernel APIs, file system APIs, network APIs and so on.

# Public

The public has framework APIs like database - arastorage, Device Management, iotbus, SmartThings Things SDK, audio and wifi manager.  
Please find it under *v1.1/public/html* folder and execute index.html.
