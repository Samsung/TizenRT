## Common
The issues below are faced during the manual setup of build environment.

### Issues on Kconfig-frontend
#### Build break on hconf
If you are using gperf 3.1 and kconfig-frontends-4.11.0.1,
you may meet below at Kconfig-frontend build(make) time:
```
~/kconfig-frontends-4.11.0.1$ make
.
.
.
In file included from libs/parser/yconf.c:252:0:
libs/parser/hconf.gperf:153:1: error: conflicting types for ‘kconf_id_lookup’
libs/parser/hconf.gperf:12:31: note: previous declaration of ‘kconf_id_lookup’ was here
 static const struct kconf_id *kconf_id_lookup(register const char *str, register GPERF_LEN_TYPE len);
                               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Makefile:1404: recipe for target 'libs/parser/libs_parser_libkconfig_parser_la-yconf.lo' failed
make[1]: *** [libs/parser/libs_parser_libkconfig_parser_la-yconf.lo] Error 1
```

To resolve:
Modify `kconfig-frontends-4.11.0.1/libs/parser/hconf.c` like below.
```diff
--- a/libs/parser/hconf.c
+++ b/libs/parser/hconf.c

-kconf_id_lookup (register const char *str, register unsigned int len)
+kconf_id_lookup (register const char *str, register GPERF_LEN_TYPE len)
 {
   enum
     {
```

#### Execution error on mconf
When ```make menuconfig``` executes after installing Kconfig-frontend, someone meets below:
```
kconfig-mconf: error while loading shared libraries: libkconfig-parser-x.xx.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Makefile.unix:579: recipe for target 'menuconfig' failed
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 127
```
To resolve:
```
cd <Kconfig-frontend_package_PATH>
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
```

### Issues with toolchain
When ```make ``` executes, you may encounter below error:
```
arm-none-eabi-gcc: Command not found
```
This may happen if the toolchain path is not added to ```PATH```.  
To resolve:
```
export PATH=<Your Toolchain PATH>:$PATH
```
If toolchain path is added to ```PATH```, then this may be because the toolchain you 
set uses 32-bit libs on the 64-bit system. For this matter, install the below toolchain 
as alternative.  
To resolve:
```
> $ sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

### Issue on build of Proto buffers
When Proto buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) which is mandatory on using gRPC is enabled, 
you can meet build breaks as shown below:
```
AR: helloxx_main.o
make[2]: Leaving directory '/TizenRT/apps/examples/helloxx'
make[2]: Entering directory '/TizenRT/apps/examples/grpc_greeter_client'
protoc -I . --cpp_out=. helloworld.proto
make[2]: protoc: Command not found
Makefile:86: recipe for target 'helloworld.pb.cc' failed
make[2]: *** [helloworld.pb.cc] Error 127
make[2]: Leaving directory '/TizenRT/apps/examples/grpc_greeter_client'
Makefile:109: recipe for target 'examples/grpc_greeter_client_all' failed
make[1]: *** [examples/grpc_greeter_client_all] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/TizenRT/apps'
LibTargets.mk:158: recipe for target '../apps/libapps.a' failed
make: *** [../apps/libapps.a] Error 2
```
This is coming from missing ```protoc``` installation.  
Please find [Proto buffers' README](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/external/protobuf/README.md).

### ARTIK
#### Issues on Programming
When USB connection is not established, someone meets below:
```

```

To resolve,  
1. See [USB device rules](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/build/configs/artik053/README.md#add-usb-device-rules).
2. Change or re-plugin USB cable and confirm USB connection.
