  /* If CONFIG_ARCH_LOWVECTORS is defined, then the vectors located at the
   * beginning of the .text region must appear at address at the address
   * specified in the VBAR.  There are two ways to accomplish this:
   *
   *   1. By explicitly mapping the beginning of .text region with a page
   *      table entry so that the virtual address zero maps to the beginning
   *      of the .text region.  VBAR == 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *   2. Set the Cortex-A5 VBAR register so that the vector table address
   *      is moved to a location other than 0x0000:0000.
   *
   *      This is the method used by this logic.
   *
   * The system always boots from the ROM memory at address 0x0.  After
   * reset, and until the Remap command is performed, the OCRAM is accessible
   * at address 0x0090 0000.
   *
   * If we are executing from external SDRAM, then a secondary bootloader
   * must have loaded us into SDRAM.  In this case, simply set the VBAR
   * register to the address of the vector table (not necessary at the
   * beginning or SDRAM).
