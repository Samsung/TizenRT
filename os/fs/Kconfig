config DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	bool "Disable support for mount points"
	default n

config DISABLE_PSEUDOFS_OPERATIONS
	bool "Disable pseudo-filesystem operations"
	default y if DEFAULT_SMALL
	default n if !DEFAULT_SMALL
	---help---
		Disable certain operations on pseudo-file systems include mkdir,
		rmdir, unlink, and rename.  These are necessary for the logical
		completeness of the illusion created by the pseudo-filesystem.
		However, in practical embedded system, they are seldom needed and
		you can save a little FLASH space by disabling the capability.

config FS_READABLE
	bool
	default y

config FS_WRITABLE
	bool

config SYSLOG
	bool "Advanced SYSLOG features"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables generic system logging features.  NOTE: This setting is not
		required to enable system logging.  If this feature is not enable
		system logging will still be available and will log to the system
		console (like printf()).  This setting is required to enable
		customization of the basic system logging capability.
		If this is enabled with SYSLOG2LOGM feature, syslog messages will be printed through logm.

config SYSLOG_TIMESTAMP
	bool "Prepend timestamp to syslog message"
	default n
	---help---
		Prepend timestamp to syslog message.

if SYSLOG

config SYSLOG_CHAR
	bool "System log character device support"
	default y
	---help---
		Enable the generic character device for the SYSLOG. The full path to the
		SYSLOG device is provided by SYSLOG_DEVPATH. A valid character device (or
		file) must exist at this path.  It will by opened by syslog_initialize.

		Do not enable more than one SYSLOG device.

config SYSLOG_DEVPATH
	string "System log device"
	default "/dev/console" if EXAMPLES_TESTCASE_KERNEL
	default "/dev/syslog" if !EXAMPLES_TESTCASE_KERNEL
	depends on SYSLOG_CHAR
	---help---
		The full path to the system logging device.  For the RAMLOG SYSLOG device,
		this is normally "/dev/ramlog".  For character SYSLOG devices, it should be
		some other existing character device (or file) supported by the configuration
		(such as "/dev/ttyS1")/

config GENERATE_FS_IMAGE
	bool "Generate fs image"
	depends on FLASH_PARTITION && FS_SMARTFS
	default n
	---help---
		If enabled, smartfs image is generated when build if there is a smartfs partition
		in the partition list(CONFIG_FLASH_PART_TYPE).
		If no content added before build, empty smartfs image will be generated.
