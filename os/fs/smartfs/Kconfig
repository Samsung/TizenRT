config FS_SMARTFS
	bool "SMART file system"
	default y
	depends on !DISABLE_MOUNTPOINT
	select FS_READABLE
	select FS_WRITABLE
	---help---
		Enable TinyAra SMART Flash file system (SMARTFS) support.

if FS_SMARTFS

menu "SMARTFS options"

config SMARTFS_ERASEDSTATE
	hex "FLASH erased state"
	default 0xff
	---help---
		The erased state of FLASH.
		This must have one of the values of 0xff or 0x00.
		Default: 0xff.

config SMARTFS_MAXNAMLEN
	int "Maximum file name length"
	default 32
	---help---	
		The maximum size of a SMARTFS file name at a given
		directory level.  Overall path name is not restricted
		by this value, only individual segments in a path,
		such as (assuming /usr is the mount point):

			/usr/games/chess/player_stats/game1.xml

		Default: 16.

config SMARTFS_MULTI_ROOT_DIRS
	bool "Support multiple Root Directories / Mount Points"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables support for multiple root directory entries
		on the SMART FLASH.  Multiple root directories means
		the device can have multiple mount point in the VFS,
		each with it's own unique directory structure under it.

		When this option is enabled, instead of reporting the
		SMART block devices as "/dev/mtdsmart0", they will be
		reported as "/dev/mtdsmart0d1", "/dev/mtdsmart0d2", etc.
		The number of root entries actually created is set
		during the "mksmartfs" command when the device is
		initialized.

		Default: y.

config SMARTFS_ALIGNED_ACCESS
	bool "Ensure 16 and 32 bit accesses are alined"
	default y
	---help---
		Performs little endian byte accesses to 16 and 32 values
		within the directory list to ensure processors that can't
		handle un-aligned accesses don't bomb out.  Default should
		probably by 'Y', but set to 'N' in case any existing Big
		Endian instances of SmartFS exist that already have
		directories with data stored in big endian mode.

config SMARTFS_BAD_SECTOR
bool "Bad Sector Management"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables Bad Sector Management for SMART FS to ensure data
                consistency of the persistant storage (Flash).

config SMARTFS_DYNAMIC_HEADER
bool "Dynamic Header"
	default n
	---help---
		Using Modified Used Byte Method to Reduce Sector Relocation 

config SMARTFS_JOURNALING
        bool "Enable filesystem journaling for smartfs"
        default n
        ---help---
                Enables logging of write operations on filesystem, so that in
                case of power failure the filesystem can be brought to a stable
                state with minimal data loss.
                Enabling journaling will increase the delay in filesystem
                operations, because before doing any fs operation, journaling
                will first log it in journal area. The journal area will also
                take up space in the flash, leaving lesser space for filesystem.
                The space reserved for journal area is proportional to max number
                of file descriptors allowed and sector size defined. Thus, to
                minimize the area reserved for journaling, it is advised to keep
                sector size small.
                
if SMARTFS_JOURNALING

config SMARTFS_JOURNAL_VERIFY
	bool "Verify Journal logging"
	default n
	---help---
		The read & verify joural value after right
		Sometimes electronic power grow up after power off, in this case
		FS decide write finished properly, but it doesn't finished properly.
		To prevent this, verifying needed.
		On the other hands, it takes more time for most of file operation that
		using journal Logging.

config SMARTFS_SECTOR_RECOVERY
	bool "Enable recovery of lost sectors in Filesystem"
	default n
	---help---
		Enables recovery of lost sectors after power failure. Lost
		sectors are the sectors which are allocated but not reachable
		from root directory.

config SMARTFS_SECURE
	bool "Secure File System"
	default n
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_SW_AES
	---help---
		Provides encryption & decryption support using AES algorithm.
