/* User defined ioctl commands are also supported.  However, the TSC driver must
 * reserve a block of commands as follows in order prevent IOCTL command numbers

 *
 * This is generally done as follows.  The first reservation for TSC driver A would
 * look like:
 *
 *   TSC_A_FIRST                 (TSC_FIRST + TSC_NCMDS)     <- First command
 *   TSC_A_NCMDS                 42                          <- Number of commands
 *
 * IOCTL commands for TSC driver A would then be defined in a TSC A header file like:
 *
 *   TSCIOC_A_CMD1               _TSIOC(TSC_A_FIRST+0)
 *   TSCIOC_A_CMD2               _TSIOC(TSC_A_FIRST+1)
 *   TSCIOC_A_CMD3               _TSIOC(TSC_A_FIRST+2)
 *   ...
 *   TSCIOC_A_CMD42              _TSIOC(TSC_A_FIRST+41)
 *
 * The next reservation would look like:
 *
 *   TSC_B_FIRST                 (TSC_A_FIRST + TSC_A_NCMDS) <- Next command
 *   TSC_B_NCMDS                 77                          <- Number of commands
