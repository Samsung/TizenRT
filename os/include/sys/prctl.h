/* Supported prctl() commands.
 *
 *  PR_SET_NAME
 *    Set the calling task (or thread) name, using the value in the location 
 *    pointed to by required arg1(char*).
 *    The name can be up to CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE long (including
 *    any null termination).  The thread ID of 0 will set the name of the
 *    calling thread. As an example:
 *
 *      prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "MyName");
 *
 *  PR_SET_NAME_BYPID
 *    Set the task (or thread) name for the thread whose ID is in required
 *    arg2 (int), using the value in the location pointed to by required arg1
 *    (char*).  The name can be up to CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE long (including
 *    any null termination). As an example:
 *
 *      prctl(PR_SET_NAME_BYPID, "MyName", 0);
 *
 *  PR_GET_NAME
 *    Return the calling task (or thread) name, in the buffer pointed to 
 *    by optional arg1 (char *). The buffer must be CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE long
 *    (including any null termination). As an example:
 *
 *      char myname[CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE];
 *      prctl(PR_GET_NAME, myname);
 *
 *  PR_GET_NAME_BYPID
 *    Return the task (or thread) name for the for the thread whose ID is
 *    optional arg2 (int), in the buffer pointed to by optional arg1 (char *).
 *    The buffer must be CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE long (including any null
 *    termination). As an example:
 *
 *      char myname[CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE];
 *      prctl(PR_GET_NAME_BYPID, myname, 0);
 *
 *  PR_GET_TGTASK
 *    Return the main task id in the own group through arg2 (int *).
 *    If parent-child relationship is not supported, the ID of its own
 *    task/thread is returned. As an example:
 *
 *      int ppid;
 *      prctl(PR_GET_TGTASK, &ppid);
