/****************************************************************************
 * Name: task_exit
 *
 * Description:
 *   This is a part of the logic used to implement _exit().  The full
 *   implementation of _exit() is architecture-dependent. The _exit()
 *   function also implements the bottom half of exit() and pthread_exit().
 *
 *   This function causes the currently running task (i.e., the task at the
 *   head of the ready-to-run list) to cease to exist.  This function should
 *   never be called from normal user code, but only from the architecture-
 *   specific implementation of exit.
 *
 *   Threads/tasks could also be terminated via pthread_cancel, task_delete(),
 *   and task_restart().  In the last two cases, the task will be terminated
 *   as though exit() were called.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   None
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   OK on success; or ERROR on failure
 *
 * Assumeptions:
 *   Interrupts are disabled.
 *
