 * Name: mq_notify
 *
 * Description:
 *   If "notification" is not NULL, this function connects the task with
 *   the message queue such that the specified signal will be sent to the
 *   task whenever the message changes from empty to non-empty.  Only one
 *   notification can be attached to a message queue.
 *
 *   If "notification" is NULL, the attached notification is detached (if
 *   it was held by the calling task) and the queue is available to attach
 *   another notification.
 *
 *   When the notification is sent to the registered process, its
 *   registration will be removed.  The message queue will then be
 *   available for registration.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   mqdes - Message queue descriptor
 *   notification - Real-time signal structure containing:
 *      sigev_notify - Should be SIGEV_SIGNAL (but actually ignored)
 *      sigev_signo - The signo to use for the notification
 *      sigev_value - Value associated with the signal
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   On success mq_notify() returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, with
 *   errno set to indicate the error.
 *
 *   EBADF The descriptor specified in mqdes is invalid.
 *   EBUSY Another process has already registered to receive notification
 *     for this message queue.
 *   EINVAL sevp->sigev_notify is not one of the permitted values; or
 *     sevp->sigev_notify is SIGEV_SIGNAL and sevp->sigev_signo is not a
 *     valid signal number.
 *   ENOMEM
 *     Insufficient memory.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
 * POSIX Compatibility:
 *   int mq_notify(mqd_t mqdes, const struct sigevent *notification);
 *
 *   The notification will be sent to the registered task even if another
 *   task is waiting for the message queue to become non-empty.  This is
 *   inconsistent with the POSIX specification which says, "If a process
 *   has registered for notification of message a arrival at a message
 *   queue and some process is blocked in mq_receive() waiting to receive
 *   a message when a message arrives at the queue, the arriving message
 *   message shall satisfy mq_receive()... The resulting behavior is as if
 *   the message queue remains empty, and no notification shall be sent."
