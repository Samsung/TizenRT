 * Name: os_start

 * Name: os_smp_start
 *
 * Description:
 *   In an SMP configution, only one CPU is initially active (CPU 0). System
 *   initialization occurs on that single thread. At the completion of the
 *   initialization of the OS, just before beginning normal multitasking,
 *   the additional CPUs would be started by calling this function.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success; a negated errno value on failure.

 * Name: os_bringup
 *
 * Description:
 *   Start all initial system tasks.  This does the "system bring-up" after
 *   the conclusion of basic OS initialization.  These initial system tasks
 *   may include:
 *
 *   - pg_worker:   The page-fault worker thread (only if CONFIG_PAGING is
 *                  defined.
 *   - work_thread: The work thread.  This general thread can be used to
 *                  perform most any kind of queued work.  Its primary
 *                  function is to serve as the "bottom half" of device
 *                  drivers.
 *
 *   And the main application entry point:
 *   symbols:
 *
 *   - USER_ENTRYPOINT: This is the default user application entry point.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None

 * Returned Value:
