 * Name: group_bind
 *
 * Description:

 *   this (at the return from group_join, things are a little unstable:  The

 *   Then, after the new thread is initialized and has a PID assigned to it,
 *   group_join() is called, incrementing the tg_nmembers count on the group.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   tcb - The TCB of the new "child" task that need to join the group.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   0 (OK) on success; a negated errno value on failure.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The parent task from which the group will be inherited is the task at
 *   thead of the ready to run list.
 * - Called during thread creation in a safe context.  No special precautions
