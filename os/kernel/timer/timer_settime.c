/********************************************************************************
 * Name: timer_settime
 *
 * Description:
 *   The timer_settime() function sets the time until the next expiration of the
 *   timer specified by timerid from the it_value member of the value argument
 *   and arm the timer if the it_value member of value is non-zero. If the
 *   specified timer was already armed when timer_settime() is called, this call
 *   will reset the time until next expiration to the value specified. If the
 *   it_value member of value is zero, the timer will be disarmed. The effect
 *   of disarming or resetting a timer with pending expiration notifications is
 *   unspecified.
 *
 *   If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the argument flags, timer_settime()
 *   will behave as if the time until next expiration is set to be equal to the
 *   interval specified by the it_value member of value. That is, the timer will
 *   expire in it_value nanoseconds from when the call is made. If the flag
 *   TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the argument flags, timer_settime() will behave as
 *   if the time until next expiration is set to be equal to the difference between
 *   the absolute time specified by the it_value member of value and the current
 *   value of the clock associated with timerid.  That is, the timer will expire
 *   when the clock reaches the value specified by the it_value member of value.
 *   If the specified time has already passed, the function will succeed and the
 *   expiration notification will be made.
 *
 *   The reload value of the timer will be set to the value specified by the
 *   it_interval member of value.  When a timer is armed with a non-zero
 *   it_interval, a periodic (or repetitive) timer is specified.
 *
 *   Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer multiples
 *   of the resolution of the specified timer will be rounded up to the larger
 *   multiple of the resolution. Quantization error will not cause the timer to
 *   expire earlier than the rounded time value.
 *
 *   If the argument ovalue is not NULL, the timer_settime() function will store,
 *   in the location referenced by ovalue, a value representing the previous
 *   amount of time before the timer would have expired, or zero if the timer was
 *   disarmed, together with the previous timer reload value. Timers will not
 *   expire before their scheduled time.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   timerid - The pre-thread timer, previously created by the call to
 *     timer_create(), to be be set.
 *   flags - Specifie characteristics of the timer (see above)
 *   value - Specifies the timer value to set
 *   ovalue - A location in which to return the time remaining from the previous
 *     timer setting. (ignored)
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   If the timer_settime() succeeds, a value of 0 (OK) will be returned.
 *   If an error occurs, the value -1 (ERROR) will be returned, and errno set to
 *   indicate the error.
 *
 *   EINVAL - The timerid argument does not correspond to an ID returned by
 *     timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete().
 *   EINVAL - A value structure specified a nanosecond value less than zero or
 *     greater than or equal to 1000 million, and the it_value member of that
 *     structure did not specify zero seconds and nanoseconds.
 *
 * Assumptions:
