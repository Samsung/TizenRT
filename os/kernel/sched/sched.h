 *  - Tasks/threads that have not been assigned to a CPU.
 *
 * Otherwise, the TCB will be retained in an assigned task list,
 * g_assignedtasks.  As its name suggests, on 'g_assignedtasks queue for CPU
 * 'n' would contain only tasks/threads that are assigned to CPU 'n'.  Tasks/
 * threads would be assigned a particular CPU by one of two mechanisms:

 * the thread has been assigned.  Hence, the g_readytorun list would hold
 * only unassigned tasks/threads.

 * is prioritized:  The head of the list is the currently active task on this

 * task exclusive access to the (multiple) CPU resources (at least without
 * stopping the other CPUs): Even though pre-emption is disabled, other
 * threads will still be executing on the other CPUS.
 *
 * There are additional rules for this multi-CPU case:
 *
 * 1. There is a global lock count 'g_cpu_lockset' that includes a bit for
 *    each CPU: If the bit is '1', then the corresponding CPU has the
 *    scheduler locked; if '0', then the CPU does not have the scheduler
 *    locked.
 * 2. Scheduling logic would set the bit associated with the cpu in
 *    'g_cpu_lockset' when the TCB at the head of the g_assignedtasks[cpu]
 *    list transitions has 'lockcount' > 0. This might happen when
 *    sched_lock() is called, or after a context switch that changes the
 *    TCB at the head of the g_assignedtasks[cpu] list.
 * 3. Similarly, the cpu bit in the global 'g_cpu_lockset' would be cleared
 *    when the TCB at the head of the g_assignedtasks[cpu] list has
 *    'lockcount' == 0. This might happen when sched_unlock() is called, or
 *    after a context switch that changes the TCB at the head of the
 *    g_assignedtasks[cpu] list.
 * 4. Modification of the global 'g_cpu_lockset' must be protected by a
 *    spinlock, 'g_cpu_schedlock'. That spinlock would be taken when
 *    sched_lock() is called, and released when sched_unlock() is called.
 *    This assures that the scheduler does enforce the critical section.
 *    NOTE: Because of this spinlock, there should never be more than one
 *    bit set in 'g_cpu_lockset'; attempts to set additional bits should
 *    be cause the CPU to block on the spinlock.  However, additional bits
 *    could get set in 'g_cpu_lockset' due to the context switches on the
 *    various CPUs.
 * 5. Each the time the head of a g_assignedtasks[] list changes and the
 *    scheduler modifies 'g_cpu_lockset', it must also set 'g_cpu_schedlock'
 *    depending on the new state of 'g_cpu_lockset'.
 * 6. Logic that currently uses the currently running tasks lockcount
 *    instead uses the global 'g_cpu_schedlock'. A value of SP_UNLOCKED
 *    means that no CPU has pre-emption disabled; SP_LOCKED means that at
 *    least one CPU has pre-emption disabled.
