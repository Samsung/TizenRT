 * Name: sched_removereadytorun
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function removes a TCB from the ready to run list.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   rtcb - Points to the TCB that is ready-to-run
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   true if the currently active task (the head of the
 *     g_readytorun list) has changed.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The caller has established a critical section before calling this
 *   function (calling sched_lock() first is NOT a good idea -- use enter_critical_section()).
 * - The caller handles the condition that occurs if the
 *   the head of the g_readytorun list is changed.
