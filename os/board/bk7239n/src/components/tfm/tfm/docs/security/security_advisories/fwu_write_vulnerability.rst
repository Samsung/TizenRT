Background
----------

In Firmware Update partition, the ``psa_fwu_write()`` service is declared as:

.. code-block:: c

    /**
     * \brief Writes an image to its staging area.
     *
     * Writes the image data 'block' with length 'block_size' to its staging area.
     *
     * \param[in] image_id        The identifier of the image
     * \param[in] block_offset    The offset of the block being passed into block,
     *                            in bytes
     * \param[in] block           A buffer containing a block of image data. This
     *                            might be a complete image or a subset.
     * \param[in] block_size      Size of block. The size must not be greater than
     *                            PSA_FWU_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.
     *
     */
    psa_status_t psa_fwu_write(psa_image_id_t image_id,
                               size_t block_offset,
                               const void *block,
                               size_t block_size);

In IPC model, this service calls the ``tfm_fwu_write_ipc()`` API to write
the input data into the device. In this API, the ``block_size`` bytes
input data (in ``block`` argument) is read into a ``1024 bytes`` local
buffer via the ``psa_read()`` API. If the input argument ``block_size``
is greater than ``1024``, then the memory space starting from the address
of the local buffer with ``block_size`` bytes would be overwritten by the input
data in ``block`` argument.

Impact
------

In IPC model, the caller of ``psa_fwu_write()`` from SPE or NSPE can overwrite
the memory space in RAM. The overwritten memory space ranges from the address
of the local buffer which locates at the stack of Firmware Update partition to
the end of the RAM. The overwritten memory may include the data of SPM and
device drivers, as well as part of the stack of Firmware Update partition.

Mitigation
----------

Add check against the input buffer length in the ``tfm_fwu_write_ipc()`` API
before reading the input data into the local buffer. See commit `78f7530`_.
