CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE
----------------------------

A CMake language file or module to be included as the first step of all
:command:`project` command calls.  This is intended for injecting custom code
into project builds without modifying their source.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE` and
:variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE` variables.
