/* 	The TT instruction takes a memory address and returns the configuration of the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) at that address.
	The cmse_address_info_t is declared as following:
		typedef union { 
			struct cmse_address_info { 
				unsigned mpu_region:8; 
				unsigned :8; 
				unsigned mpu_region_valid:1;

				unsigned read_ok:1; 
				unsigned readwrite_ok:1; 
				unsigned :12; 
			} flags; 
			unsigned value; 
		} cmse_address_info_t;

	When executed in the secure state the result of TT instruction is extended to return the SAU and IDAU configurations at the specific address.
	The extended cmse_address_info_t is declared as following:
		typedef union {
			struct cmse_address_info {
				unsigned mpu_region:8;
				unsigned sau_region:8;
				unsigned mpu_region_valid:1;
				unsigned sau_region_valid:1;
				unsigned read_ok:1;
				unsigned readwrite_ok:1;
				unsigned nonsecure_read_ok:1;
				unsigned nonsecure_readwrite_ok:1;
				unsigned secure:1;
				unsigned idau_region_valid:1;
				unsigned idau_region:8;
			} flags;
			unsigned value;
		} cmse_address_info_t;
	
	As a result, these extended bits are only valid when executing in Secure state, and are UNDEFINED if used from Non-secure state.
