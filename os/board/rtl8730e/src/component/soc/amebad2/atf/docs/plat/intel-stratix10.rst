Intel Stratix 10 SoCFPGA
========================

Stratix 10 SoCFPGA is a FPGA with integrated quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex A53 processor.

Upon boot, Boot ROM loads bl2 into OCRAM. Bl2 subsequently initializes
the hardware, then loads bl31 and bl33 (UEFI) into DDR and boots to bl33.

    Boot ROM --> Trusted Firmware-A --> UEFI

How to build
------------

Code Locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Trusted Firmware-A:
   `link <https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware>`__

-  UEFI (to be updated with new upstreamed UEFI):
   `link <https://github.com/altera-opensource/uefi-socfpga>`__

Build Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fetch all the above 2 repositories into local host.
   Make all the repositories in the same ${BUILD\_PATH}.

-  Prepare the AARCH64 toolchain.

-  Build UEFI using Stratix 10 platform as configuration
   This will be updated to use an updated UEFI using the latest EDK2 source

.. code:: bash

       make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- device=s10

-  Build atf providing the previously generated UEFI as the BL33 image

.. code:: bash

       make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- bl2 fip PLAT=stratix10
       BL33=PEI.ROM

Install Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- dd fip.bin to a A2 partition on the MMC drive to be booted in Stratix 10
  board.

- Generate a SOF containing bl2

.. code:: bash

        aarch64-linux-gnu-objcopy -I binary -O ihex --change-addresses 0xffe00000 bl2.bin bl2.hex
        quartus_cpf --bootloader bl2.hex <quartus_generated_sof> <output_sof_with_bl2>

- Configure SOF to board

.. code:: bash

        nios2-configure-sof <output_sof_with_bl2>
