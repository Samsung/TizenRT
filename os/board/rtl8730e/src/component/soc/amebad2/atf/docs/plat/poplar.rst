Poplar
======

Poplar is the first development board compliant with the 96Boards Enterprise
Edition TV Platform specification.

The board features the Hi3798C V200 with an integrated quad-core 64-bit
Arm Cortex A53 processor and high performance Mali T720 GPU, making it capable
of running any commercial set-top solution based on Linux or Android.

It supports a premium user experience with up to H.265 HEVC decoding of 4K
video at 60 frames per second.

At the start of the boot sequence, the bootROM executes the so called l-loader
binary whose main role is to change the processor state to 64bit mode. This
must happen prior to invoking Trusted Firmware-A:

::

    l-loader --> Trusted Firmware-A --> u-boot

How to build
------------

Code Locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Trusted Firmware-A:
   `link <https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware>`__

-  l-loader:
   `link <https://github.com/Linaro/poplar-l-loader.git>`__

-  u-boot:
   `link <http://git.denx.de/u-boot.git>`__

Build Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fetch all the above 3 repositories into local host.
   Make all the repositories in the same ${BUILD\_PATH}.

-  Prepare the AARCH64 toolchain.

-  Build u-boot using poplar_defconfig

.. code:: bash

       make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- poplar_defconfig
       make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

-  Build atf providing the previously generated u-boot.bin as the BL33 image

.. code:: bash

       make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-  all fip SPD=none PLAT=poplar
       BL33=u-boot.bin

-  Build l-loader (generated the final fastboot.bin)
       1. copy the atf generated files fip.bin and bl1.bin to l-loader/atf/
       2. export ARM_TRUSTED_FIRMWARE=${ATF_SOURCE_PATH)
       3. make

Install Procedure
-----------------

- Copy l-loader/fastboot.bin to a FAT partition on a USB pen drive.

- Plug the USB pen drive to any of the USB2 ports

- Power the board while keeping S3 pressed (usb_boot)

The system will boot into a u-boot shell which you can then use to write the
working firmware to eMMC.
