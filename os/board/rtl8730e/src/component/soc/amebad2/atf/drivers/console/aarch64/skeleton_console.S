	 * This file contains a skeleton console driver that can be used as a
	 * basis for a real console driver. Console drivers in Trusted Firmware
	 * can be instantiated multiple times. Each instance is described by a
	 * separate console_t structure which must be registered with the common
	 * console framework via console_register(). Console drivers should
	 * define a console_xxx_register() function that initializes a new
	 * console_t structure passed in from the caller and registers it after
	 * initializing the console hardware. Drivers may define their own
	 * structures extending console_t to store private driver information.
	 * Console drivers *MUST* ensure that the console callbacks they
	 * implement only change registers allowed in the clobber lists defined
	 * in this file. (Note that in addition to the explicit clobber lists,
	 * any function may always clobber the intra-procedure-call registers
	 * X16 and X17, but may never depend on them retaining their values
	 * across any function call.)
