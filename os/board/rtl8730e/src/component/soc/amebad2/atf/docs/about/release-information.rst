Release Processes
=================

Project Release Cadence
-----------------------

The project currently aims to do a release once every 6 months which will be
tagged on the master branch. There will be a code freeze (stop merging
non-essential changes) up to 4 weeks prior to the target release date. The release
candidates will start appearing after this and only bug fixes or updates
required for the release will be merged. The maintainers are free to use their
judgement on what changes are essential for the release. A release branch may be
created after code freeze if there are significant changes that need merging onto
the integration branch during the merge window.

The release testing will be performed on release candidates and depending on
issues found, additional release candidates may be created to fix the issues.
