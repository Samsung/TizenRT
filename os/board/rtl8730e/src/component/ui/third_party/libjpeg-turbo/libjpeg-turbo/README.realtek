Any Realtek specific modifications to upstream libjpeg - turbo(1.5.3) should
be listed here:

(1) jconfig.h and jconfigint.h

These are included upstream as jconfig.h.in and jconfigint.h.in.
We have the option autogenerate these platform / version specific files(using
		the libjpeg - turbo build system) or to manually create them.

Autogenerating these files on linux gets us most of the way, but we've needed
to add some multi - platform flexibility to the INLINE and SIZEOF_SIZE_T macros.
