 1.    INTRODUCTION
The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software
that implements the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding
scheme for digital audio. This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on
a wide variety of Android devices.

AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient
general perceptual audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing
full-bandwidth communications codec by independent studies and is widely
deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part of the MPEG
specifications.

Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including
those of Fraunhofer) may be obtained through Via Licensing
(www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners individually for
the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant
with the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of
Android devices already license these patent claims through Via Licensing or
directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec software may
already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those
licensed purposes only.

Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions
with enhanced sound quality, are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are
encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications

\section SCOPE Scope

This document describes the high-level application interface and usage of the
ISO/MPEG-2/4 AAC Decoder library developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for
Integrated Circuits (IIS). Depending on the library configuration, decoding of
AAC-LC (Low-Complexity), HE-AAC (High-Efficiency AAC v1 and v2), AAC-LD
(Low-Delay) and AAC-ELD (Enhanced Low-Delay) is implemented.

All references to SBR (Spectral Band Replication) are only applicable to HE-AAC
and AAC-ELD configurations of the FDK library. All references to PS (Parametric
Stereo) are only applicable to HE-AAC v2 decoder configuration of the library.

\section DecoderBasics Decoder Basics

This document can only give a rough overview about the ISO/MPEG-2, ISO/MPEG-4
AAC audio and MPEG-D USAC coding standards. To understand all details referenced
in this document, you are encouraged to read the following documents.

- ISO/IEC 13818-7 (MPEG-2 AAC) Standard, defines the syntax of MPEG-2 AAC audio
bitstreams.
- ISO/IEC 14496-3 (MPEG-4 AAC, subpart 1 and 4) Standard, defines the syntax of
MPEG-4 AAC audio bitstreams.
- ISO/IEC 23003-3 (MPEG-D USAC), defines MPEG-D USAC unified speech and audio
codec.
- Lutzky, Schuller, Gayer, Kr&auml;mer, Wabnik, "A guideline to audio codec
delay", 116th AES Convention, May 8, 2004

In short, MPEG Advanced Audio Coding is based on a time-to-frequency mapping of
the signal. The signal is partitioned into overlapping time portions and
transformed into frequency domain. The spectral components are then quantized
and coded using a highly efficient coding scheme.\n Encoded MPEG-2 and MPEG-4
AAC audio bitstreams are composed of frames. Contrary to MPEG-1/2 Layer-3 (mp3),
the length of individual frames is not restricted to a fixed number of bytes,
but can take any length between 1 and 768 bytes.

In addition to the above mentioned frequency domain coding mode, MPEG-D USAC
also employs a time domain Algebraic Code-Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP)
speech coder core. This operating mode is selected by the encoder in order to
achieve the optimum audio quality for different content type. Several
enhancements allow achieving higher quality at lower bit rates compared to
MPEG-4 HE-AAC.

\section Calling_Sequence Calling Sequence

The following sequence is necessary for proper decoding of ISO/MPEG-2/4 AAC,
HE-AAC v2, or MPEG-D USAC bitstreams. In the following description, input stream
read and output write function details are left out, since they may be
implemented in a variety of configurations depending on the user's specific
requirements.


-# Call aacDecoder_Open() to open and retrieve a handle to a new AAC decoder
instance. \code aacDecoderInfo = aacDecoder_Open(transportType, nrOfLayers);
\endcode
-# If out-of-band config data (Audio Specific Config (ASC) or Stream Mux Config
(SMC)) is available, call aacDecoder_ConfigRaw() to pass this data to the
decoder before beginning the decoding process. If this data is not available in
advance, the decoder will configure itself while decoding, during the
aacDecoder_DecodeFrame() function call.
-# Begin decoding loop.
\code
do {
\endcode
-# Read data from bitstream file or stream buffer in to the driver program
working memory (a client-supplied input buffer "inBuffer" in framework). This
buffer will be used to load AAC bitstream data to the decoder.  Only when all
data in this buffer has been processed will the decoder signal an empty buffer.
-# Call aacDecoder_Fill() to fill the decoder's internal bitstream input buffer
with the client-supplied bitstream input buffer. Note, if the data loaded in to
the internal buffer is not sufficient to decode a frame,
aacDecoder_DecodeFrame() will return ::AAC_DEC_NOT_ENOUGH_BITS until a
sufficient amount of data is loaded in to the internal buffer. For streaming
formats (ADTS, LOAS), it is acceptable to load more than one frame to the
decoder. However, for packed based formats, only one frame may be loaded to the
decoder per aacDecoder_DecodeFrame() call. For least amount of communication
delay, fill and decode should be performed on a frame by frame basis. \code
    ErrorStatus = aacDecoder_Fill(aacDecoderInfo, inBuffer, bytesRead,
bytesValid); \endcode
-# Call aacDecoder_DecodeFrame(). This function decodes one frame and writes
decoded PCM audio data to a client-supplied buffer. It is the client's
responsibility to allocate a buffer which is large enough to hold the decoded
output data. \code ErrorStatus = aacDecoder_DecodeFrame(aacDecoderInfo,
TimeData, OUT_BUF_SIZE, flags); \endcode If the bitstream configuration (number
of channels, sample rate, frame size) is not known a priori, you may call
aacDecoder_GetStreamInfo() to retrieve a structure that contains this
information. You may use this data to initialize an audio output device. \code
    p_si = aacDecoder_GetStreamInfo(aacDecoderInfo);
\endcode
-# Repeat steps 5 to 7 until no data is available to decode any more, or in case
of error. \code } while (bytesRead[0] > 0 || doFlush || doBsFlush ||
forceContinue); \endcode
-# Call aacDecoder_Close() to de-allocate all AAC decoder and transport layer
structures. \code aacDecoder_Close(aacDecoderInfo); \endcode

\subsection Error_Concealment_Sequence Error Concealment Sequence

There are different strategies to handle bit stream errors. Depending on the
system properties the product designer might choose to take different actions in
case a bit error occurs. In many cases the decoder might be able to do
reasonable error concealment without the need of any additional actions from the
system. But in some cases its not even possible to know how many decoded PCM
output samples are required to fill the gap due to the data error, then the
software surrounding the decoder must deal with the situation. The most simple
way would be to just stop audio playback and resume once enough bit stream data
and/or buffered output samples are available. More sophisticated designs might
also be able to deal with sender/receiver clock drifts or data drop outs by
using a closed loop control of FIFO fulness levels. The chosen strategy depends
on the final product requirements.

The error concealment sequence diagram illustrates the general execution paths
for error handling.

The macro IS_OUTPUT_VALID(err) can be used to identify if the audio output
buffer contains valid audio either from error free bit stream data or successful
error concealment. In case the result is false, the decoder output buffer does
not contain meaningful audio samples and should not be passed to any output as
it is. Most likely in case that a continuous audio output PCM stream is
required, the output buffer must be filled with audio data from the calling
framework. This might be e.g. an appropriate number of samples all zero.

If error code ::AAC_DEC_TRANSPORT_SYNC_ERROR is returned by the decoder, under
some particular conditions it is possible to estimate lost frames due to the bit
stream error. In that case the bit stream is required to have a constant
bitrate, and compatible transport type. Audio samples for the lost frames can be
obtained by calling aacDecoder_DecodeFrame() with flag ::AACDEC_CONCEAL set
n-times where n is the count of lost frames. Please note that the decoder has to
have encountered valid configuration data at least once to be able to generate
concealed data, because at the minimum the sampling rate, frame size and amount
of audio channels needs to be known.

If it is not possible to get an estimation of lost frames then a constant
fullness of the audio output buffer can be achieved by implementing different
FIFO control techniques e.g. just stop taking of samples from the buffer to
avoid underflow or stop filling new data to the buffer to avoid overflow. But
this techniques are out of scope of this document.

For a detailed description of a specific error code please refer also to
::AAC_DECODER_ERROR.

\section BufferSystem Buffer System

There are three main buffers in an AAC decoder application. One external input
buffer to hold bitstream data from file I/O or elsewhere, one decoder-internal
input buffer, and one to hold the decoded output PCM sample data. In resource
limited applications, the output buffer may be reused as an external input
buffer prior to the subsequence aacDecoder_Fill() function call.

To feed the data to the decoder-internal input buffer, use the
function aacDecoder_Fill(). This function returns important information
regarding the number of bytes in the external input buffer that have not yet
been copied into the internal input buffer (variable bytesValid). Once the
external buffer has been fully copied, it can be completely re-filled again. In
case you wish to refill the buffer while there are unprocessed bytes (bytesValid
is unequal 0), you should preserve the unconsumed data. However, we recommend to
refill the buffer only when bytesValid returns 0.

The bytesValid parameter is an input and output parameter to the FDK decoder. As
an input, it signals how many valid bytes are available in the external buffer.
After consumption of the external buffer using aacDecoder_Fill() function, the
bytesValid parameter indicates if any of the bytes in the external buffer were
not consumed.

\page OutputFormat Decoder audio output

\section OutputFormatObtaining Obtaining channel mapping information

The decoded audio output format is indicated by a set of variables of the
CStreamInfo structure. While the struct members sampleRate, frameSize and
numChannels might be self explanatory, pChannelType and pChannelIndices require
some further explanation.

These two arrays indicate the configuration of channel data within the output
buffer. Both arrays have CStreamInfo::numChannels number of cells. Each cell of
pChannelType indicates the channel type, which is described in the enum
::AUDIO_CHANNEL_TYPE (defined in FDK_audio.h). The cells of pChannelIndices
indicate the sub index among the channels starting with 0 among channels of the
same audio channel type.

The indexing scheme is structured as defined in MPEG-2/4 Standards. Indices
start from the front direction (a center channel if available, will always be
index 0) and increment, starting with the left side, pairwise (e.g. L, R) and
from front to back (Front L, Front R, Surround L, Surround R). For detailed
explanation, please refer to ISO/IEC 13818-7:2005(E), chapter 8.5.3.2.

In case a Program Config is included in the audio configuration, the channel
mapping described within it will be adopted.

The examples below explain these aspects in detail.

\section OutputFormatChange Changing the audio output format

For MPEG-4 audio the channel order can be changed at runtime through the
parameter
::AAC_PCM_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_MAPPING. See the description of those
parameters and the decoder library function aacDecoder_SetParam() for more
detail.

\section OutputFormatExample Channel mapping examples

The following examples illustrate the location of individual audio samples in
the audio buffer that is passed to aacDecoder_DecodeFrame() and the expected
data in the CStreamInfo structure which can be obtained by calling
aacDecoder_GetStreamInfo().

\subsection ExamplesStereo Stereo

In case of ::AAC_PCM_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_MAPPING set to 1,
a AAC-LC bit stream which has channelConfiguration = 2 in its audio specific
config would lead to the following values in CStreamInfo:

CStreamInfo::numChannels = 2

CStreamInfo::pChannelType = { ::ACT_FRONT, ::ACT_FRONT }

CStreamInfo::pChannelIndices = { 0, 1 }

The output buffer will be formatted as follows:

\verbatim
  <left sample 0>  <left sample 1>  <left sample 2>  ... <left sample N>
  <right sample 0> <right sample 1> <right sample 2> ... <right sample N>
\endverbatim

Where N equals to CStreamInfo::frameSize .

\subsection ExamplesSurround Surround 5.1

In case of ::AAC_PCM_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_MAPPING set to 1,
a AAC-LC bit stream which has channelConfiguration = 6 in its audio specific
config, would lead to the following values in CStreamInfo:

CStreamInfo::numChannels = 6

CStreamInfo::pChannelType = { ::ACT_FRONT, ::ACT_FRONT, ::ACT_FRONT, ::ACT_LFE,
::ACT_BACK, ::ACT_BACK }

CStreamInfo::pChannelIndices = { 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1 }

Since ::AAC_PCM_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_MAPPING is 1, WAV file channel ordering will be
used. For a 5.1 channel scheme, thus the channels would be: front left, front
right, center, LFE, surround left, surround right. Thus the third channel is the
center channel, receiving the index 0. The other front channels are front left,
front right being placed as first and second channels with indices 1 and 2
correspondingly. There is only one LFE, placed as the fourth channel and index
0. Finally both surround channels get the type definition ACT_BACK, and the
indices 0 and 1.

The output buffer will be formatted as follows:

\verbatim
<front left sample 0> <front right sample 0>
<center sample 0> <LFE sample 0>
<surround left sample 0> <surround right sample 0>

<front left sample 1> <front right sample 1>
<center sample 1> <LFE sample 1>
<surround left sample 1> <surround right sample 1>

...

<front left sample N> <front right sample N>
<center sample N> <LFE sample N>
<surround left sample N> <surround right sample N>
\endverbatim

Where N equals to CStreamInfo::frameSize .

\subsection ExamplesArib ARIB coding mode 2/1

In case of ::AAC_PCM_OUTPUT_CHANNEL_MAPPING set to 1,
in case of a ARIB bit stream using coding mode 2/1 as described in ARIB STD-B32
Part 2 Version 2.1-E1, page 61, would lead to the following values in
CStreamInfo:

CStreamInfo::numChannels = 3

CStreamInfo::pChannelType = { ::ACT_FRONT, ::ACT_FRONT, ::ACT_BACK }

CStreamInfo::pChannelIndices = { 0, 1, 0 }

The audio channels will be placed as follows in the audio output buffer:

\verbatim
<front left sample 0> <front right sample 0>  <mid surround sample 0>

<front left sample 1> <front right sample 1> <mid surround sample 1>

...

<front left sample N> <front right sample N> <mid surround sample N>

Where N equals to CStreamInfo::frameSize .
