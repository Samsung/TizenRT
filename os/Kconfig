config WINDOWS_MKLINK
	bool "Use mklink"
	default n
	depends on WINDOWS_NATIVE
	---help---
		Use the mklink command to set up symbolic links when TinyAra is
		configured.  Otherwise, configuration directories will be copied to
		establish the configuration.

		If directories are copied, then some confusion can result ("Which
		version of the file did I modify?").  In that case, it is recommended
		that you re-build using 'make clean_context all'.  That will cause the
		configured directories to be recopied on each build.

		NOTE: This option also (1) that you have administrator privileges, (2)
		that you are using Windows 2000 or better, and (3) that you are using
		the NTFS file system.  Select 'n' is that is not the case.

menu "Build Configuration"

config APPS_DIR
	string "Application directory"
	default "../apps" if !WINDOWS_NATIVE
	default "..\apps" if WINDOWS_NATIVE
	---help---
		Identifies the directory that builds the
		application to link with TinyAra.  Default: ../apps This symbol must be assigned
		to the path to the application build directory *relative* to
		the TinyAra top build directory. If you had an application
		directory and the TinyAra directory each in separate directory
		trees like this:

			build
			|-tinyara
			|  |
			|  `- Makefile
			`-application
			|
			`- Makefile

		Then you would set APPS_DIR=../application.

		The application direction must contain Makefile and this make
		file must support the following targets:

		1)libapps$(LIBEXT) (usually libapps.a). libapps.a is a static
		library ( an archive) that contains all of application object
		files.

		2)clean. Do whatever is appropriate to clean the application
		directories for a fresh build.

		3)distclean. Clean everything -- auto-generated files, symbolic
		links etc. -- so that the directory contents are the same as
		the contents in your configuration management system.
		This is only done when you change the TinyAra configuration.

		4)depend. Make or update the application build dependencies.

		When this application is invoked it will receive the setting TOPDIR like:

		$(MAKE) -C $(CONFIG_APPS_DIR) TOPDIR="$(TOPDIR)" <target>

		TOPDIR is the full path to the TinyAra directory. It can be used, for
		example, to include makefile fragments (e.g., .config or Make.defs)
		or to set up include file paths.

	---help---
		Build TinyAra as one large, executable "blob".  All of the code
		within the blob can interrupt with all of the other code within
		the blob.  There are no special privileges, protections, or
		restraints.

config BUILD_PROTECTED
	bool "TinyAra protected build"
	depends on ARCH_USE_MPU
	select LIB_SYSCALL
	select BUILD_2PASS
	---help---
		Builds TinyAra and selected applications as two "blobs":  A protected,
		privileged kernel blob and a separate unprivileged, user blob. This
		require sue of the two pass build with each blob being build on each pass.

		NOTE:  This build configuration requires that the platform support
		a memory protection unit (MPU).  Support, however, may not be
		implemented on all platforms.

config BUILD_KERNEL
	bool "TinyAra kernel build"
	depends on ARCH_USE_MMU && ARCH_ADDRENV && EXPERIMENTAL
	select LIB_SYSCALL
	---help---
		Builds TinyAra as a separately compiled kernel.  No applications are
		built.  All user applications must reside in a file system where
		they can be loaded into memory for execution.

		NOTE:  This build configuration requires that the platform support
		a memory management unit (MMU) and address environments.  Support,
		however, may not be implemented on all platforms.

config BUILD_2PASS
	bool "Two pass build"
	default n
	depends on !BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		Enables the two pass build options.

		Two-pass build options.  If the 2 pass build option is selected, then these
		options configure the make system build a extra link object. This link object
		is assumed to be an incremental (relative) link object, but could be a static
		library (archive) (some modification to this Makefile would be required if
		PASS1_TARGET generates an archive). Pass 1 1ncremental (relative) link
		objects should be put into the processor-specific source directory (where other
		link objects will be created).  If the pass1 object is an archive, it could
		go anywhere.

if BUILD_2PASS

config PASS1_TARGET
	string "Pass one target"
	default "all"
	---help---
		The name of the first pass build target.  This
		can be specific build target, a special build target (all, default, etc.)
		or may just be left undefined.

config PASS1_OBJECT
	string "Pass one object"
	default ""
	---help---
		May be used to include an extra, pass1 object
		into the final link.  This would probably be the object generated
		from the PASS1_TARGET.  It may be available at link time
		in the arch/<architecture>/src directory.

config TINYARA_USERSPACE
	hex "Beginning of user-space blob"
	default 0x0
	depends on BUILD_PROTECTED
	---help---
		In the kernel build, the TinyAra kernel and the user-space blob are
		built separately linked objects.  TINYARA_USERSPACE provides the
		address where the user-space blob is loaded into memory.  TinyAra will
		expect to find and instance of struct userspace_s at this location.

config INTELHEX_BINARY
	bool "Intel HEX binary format"
	default n
	---help---
		Create the tinyara.hex in the Intel HEX binary format that is
		used with many different loaders. This option will use the GNU objcopy program
		and should not be selected if you are not using the GNU toolchain.

config MOTOROLA_SREC
	bool "Motorola S-Record binary format"
	default n
	---help---
		Create the tinyara.srec in the Motorola S-Record binary format that is
		used with many different loaders. This option will use the GNU objcopy program
		and should not be selected if you are not using the GNU toolchain.

config RAW_BINARY
	bool "Raw binary format"
	default n
	---help---
		Create the tinyara.bin in the raw binary format that is used with many
		different loaders using the GNU objcopy program.  This option
		should not be selected if you are not using the GNU toolchain.

config SAMSUNG_NS2
	bool "Samsung NS2 binary format"
	select RAW_BINARY
	default n
	---help---
		Create the tinyara.head.bin from the raw binary, putting
		a checksum value into it. It is used with S5J boot loaders,
		which check the integrity of the binary using SHA256 at boot.

menuconfig UBOOT_UIMAGE
	bool "U-Boot uImage"

menu "Customize Header Files"

config ARCH_STDINT_H
	bool "stdint.h"
	default n
	---help---
		The stdint.h header file can be found at tinyara/include/stdint.h.
		However, that header includes logic to redirect the inclusion of an
		architecture specific header file like:

			#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_STDINT_H
			#  include <arch/stdint.h>
			#else
			...
			#endif

		Recall that that include path, include/arch, is a symbolic link and
		will refer to a version of stdint.h at tinyara/arch/<architecture>/include/stdint.h.

config ARCH_STDBOOL_H
	bool "stdbool.h"
	default n
	---help---
		The stdbool.h header file can be found at tinyara/include/stdbool.h.
		However, that header includes logic to redirect the inclusion of an
		architecture specific header file like:

			#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_STDBOOL_H
			#  include <arch/stdbool.h>
			#else
			...
			#endif

		Recall that that include path, include/arch, is a symbolic link and
		will refer to a version of stdbool.h at tinyara/arch/<architecture>/include/stdbool.h.

config ARCH_MATH_H
	bool "math.h"
	default n
	---help---
		There is also a re-directing version of math.h in the source tree.
		However, it resides out-of-the-way at include/tinyara/math.h because it
		conflicts too often with the system math.h. If ARCH_MATH_H=y is
		defined, however, the top-level makefile will copy the redirecting
		math.h header file from include/tinyara/math.h to include/math.h. math.h
		will then include the architecture-specific version of math.h that you
		must provide at tinyara/arch/>architecture</include/math.h.

			#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_MATH_H
			#  include <arch/math.h>
			#endif

		So for the architectures that define ARCH_MATH_H=y, include/math.h
		will be the redirecting math.h header file; for the architectures
		that don't select ARCH_MATH_H, the redirecting math.h header file
		will stay out-of-the-way in include/tinyara/.

config ARCH_FLOAT_H
	bool "float.h"
	default n
	---help---
		The float.h header file defines the properties of your floating
		point implementation.  It would always be best to use your
		toolchain's float.h header file but if none is available, a default
		float.h header file will provided if this option is selected.  However
		there is no assurance that the settings in this float.h are actually
		correct for your platform!

config ARCH_STDARG_H
	bool "stdarg.h"
	default n
	---help---
		There is also a redirecting version of stdarg.h in the source tree
		as well. It also resides out-of-the-way at include/tinyara/stdarg.h.
		This is because you should normally use your toolchain's stdarg.h
		file. But sometimes, your toolchain's stdarg.h file may have other
		header file dependencies and so may not be usable in the TinyAra build
		environment. In those cases, you may have to create a architecture-
		specific stdarg.h header file at tinyara/arch/<architecture>/include/stdarg.h

		If ARCH_STDARG_H=y is defined, the top-level makefile will copy the
		re-directing stdarg.h header file from include/tinyara/stdarg.h to
		include/stdarg.h. So for the architectures that cannot use their
		toolchain's stdarg.h file, they can use this alternative by defining
		ARCH_STDARG_H=y and providing. If ARCH_STDARG_H, is not defined, then
		the stdarg.h header file will stay out-of-the-way in include/tinyara/.

	---help---
		Build full optimization.  This is the normal case for production
		firmware.
