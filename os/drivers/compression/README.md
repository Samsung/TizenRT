# Compression driver

This driver APIs are used to access compression and decompression functions of compression module.
The ioctl function of the compress driver supports following commands and accordingly perform 
following tasks .

## 1. COMPIOC_COMPRESS cmd :

For this cmd, user needs to pass a struct compress_header pointer as arg to the ioctl and need to store
the members of the struct as below : <br />
input_size     ->  input size of the data <br />
input_buffer   ->  input data <br />
output_size    ->  should be same as input size because after compression, output size will be less than or equal to input size <br />
output_buffer  ->  should be allocated before passing to ioctl function 

The ioctl function will call the compression function and compressed data will be stored in 
output_buffer and output_size will get updated to the length of compressed data. 

## 2. COMPIOC_GET_COMP_TYPE cmd :

For this cmd, user can pass arg as NULL because there is no need of an argument. The ioctl will return 
the compression type.

## 3. COMPIOC_GET_COMP_NAME cmd :

For this cmd, user needs to pass a char pointer as arg that needs to be allocated memory with a size of
COMP_NAME_SIZE (compression.h). This should be allocated memory before passing to the ioctl.
The ioctl funtion will store the compression type name string in the char pointer.

## 4. COMPIOC_DECOMPRESS cmd :

For this cmd, user needs to pass a struct compress_header pointer as arg to the ioctl and need to store
the members of the struct as below : <br />
input_size      -> input size of compressed data <br />
input_buffer    -> compressed data <br />
output_buffer   -> should be allocated before passing to ioctl funtion <br />
output_size     -> three cases are possible for output size which is discussed below 

- ##### when output size passed is equal to actual decompressed data size : <br />
        This is the case where user knows the size of decompressed data. The ioctl function will call the
        decompress funtion and it will store the decompressed data in output_buffer and output_size will 
        remain same.
    
- ##### when output size passed is more than actual decompressed data size : <br />
        This is the case where user does not know the size of decompressed data and passes the output size 
        larger than required for output buffer. The ioctl function will call the decompress funtion and it will
        store the decompressed data in output buffer and update the output_size as the actual decompressed 
        data size .Here, output_size after the ioctl call will be less than before.

- ##### when output size passed is less than actual decompressed data size : <br />
        This is the case where user does not know the size of decompressed data and passes the output size
        smaller than required for output buffer. The ioctl call will return ENOMEM (out of memory) error 
        and it will print that output buffer allocated is not sufficient. 
        User need to update the output_size to a larger value and allocate memory to output_buffer 
        and call ioctl function again to get full decompressed data.
