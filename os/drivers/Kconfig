config RTC_EPOCHYEAR
	bool "RTC epoch year"
	default n
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
		Add controls for RTCs that support epoch year settings.

		Many RTCs encode the year in an 8-bit register which is either interpreted
		as an 8-bit binary number or as a BCD number. In both cases, the number is
		interpreted relative to this RTC's Epoch. The RTC's Epoch is initialized to
		1900 on most systems but on Alpha and MIPS it might also be initialized to
		1952, 1980, or 2000, depending on the value of an RTC register for the year.
		With some RTCs, these operations can be used to read or to set the RTC's
		Epoch, respectively.
