menuconfig PM
	bool "Power management (PM) driver interfaces"
	default n
	depends on SCHED_WORKQUEUE
	---help---
		Power management (PM) driver interfaces.  These interfaces are used
		to manage power usage of a platform by monitoring driver activity
		and by placing drivers into reduce power usage modes when the
		drivers are not active.

if PM

config DEBUG_PM
	bool "Power Management Debug Features"
	default n

config PM_TEST
	bool "Power Management Functionality Test"
	default n

config PM_DEVNAME_LEN
	int "Registered device name length"
	default 32

	bool "Power management (PM) metrics"
	default n
	---help---
		Power management's metrics for CONFIG_PM_METRICS_DURATION

config PM_SLICEMS
	int "PM time slice (msec)"
	default 100
	---help---
		The power management module collects activity counts in time slices.
		At the end of the time slice, the count accumulated during that
		interval is applied to an averaging algorithm to determine the
		activity level.

		CONFIG_PM_SLICEMS provides the duration of that time slice in
		milliseconds.  Default: 100 Milliseconds

config PM_NDOMAINS
	int "Number of PM activity domains"
	default 1
	---help---
		Defines the number of "domains" that activity may be monitored on.
		For example, you may want to separately manage the power from the
		Network domain, shutting down the network when it is not be used,
		from the UI domain, shutting down the UI when it is not in use.

config PM_MEMORY
	int "PM memory (msec)"
	default 2
	range 1 6
	---help---
		The averaging algorithm is simply: Y = (An*X + SUM(Ai*Yi))/SUM(Aj),
		where i = 1..n-1 and j= 1..n, n is the length of the "memory",
		Ai is the weight applied to each value, and X is the current
		activity.  These weights may be negative and a limited to the
		range of int16_t.

			CONFIG_PM_MEMORY provides the memory for the algorithm.  Default: 2
			CONFIG_PM_COEFn provides weight for each sample.  Default: 1

		Setting CONFIG_PM_MEMORY=1 disables all smoothing.
