 * Name: pm_initialize

 * Description:
 *   This function is called by MCU-specific one-time at power on reset in
 *   order to initialize the power management capabilities.  This function
 *   must be called *very* early in the initializeation sequence *before* any
 *   other device drivers are initialize (since they may attempt to register
 *   with the power management subsystem).
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   None.
 *
 * Returned value:
 *    None.
