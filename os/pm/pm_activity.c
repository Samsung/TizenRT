 * Name: pm_activity
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called by a device driver to indicate that it is
 *   performing meaningful activities (non-idle).  This increments an activity
 *   count and/or will restart a idle timer and prevent entering reduced
 *   power states.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   domain - The domain of the PM activity
 *   priority - Activity priority, range 0-9.  Larger values correspond to
 *     higher priorities.  Higher priority activity can prevent the system
 *     from entering reduced power states for a longer period of time.
 *
 *     As an example, a button press might be higher priority activity because
 *     it means that the user is actively interacting with the device.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function may be called from an interrupt handler (this is the ONLY
 *   PM function that may be called from an interrupt handler!).
