/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pm_checkstate
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from the MCU-specific IDLE loop to monitor the
 *   the power management conditions.  This function returns the "recommended"
 *   power management state based on the PM configuration and activity
 *   reported in the last sampling periods.  The power management state is
 *   not automatically changed, however.  The IDLE loop must call
 *   pm_changestate() in order to make the state change.
 *
 *   These two steps are separated because the platform-specific IDLE loop may
 *   have additional situational information that is not available to the
 *   the PM sub-system.  For example, the IDLE loop may know that the
 *   battery charge level is very low and may force lower power states
 *   even if there is activity.
 *
 *   NOTE: That these two steps are separated in time and, hence, the IDLE
 *   loop could be suspended for a long period of time between calling
 *   pm_checkstate() and pm_changestate().  The IDLE loop may need to make
 *   these calls atomic by either disabling interrupts until the state change
 *   is completed.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   domain - The PM domain to check
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The recommended power management state.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pm_changestate
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is used to platform-specific power management logic.  It
 *   will announce the power management power management state change to all
 *   drivers that have registered for power management event callbacks.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   newstate - Identifies the new PM state
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   0 (OK) means that the callback function for all registered drivers
 *   returned OK (meaning that they accept the state change).  Non-zero
 *   means that one of the drivers refused the state change.  In this case,
 *   the system will revert to the preceding state.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   It is assumed that interrupts are disabled when this function is
 *   called.  This function is probably called from the IDLE loop... the
 *   lowest priority task in the system.  Changing driver power management
 *   states may result in renewed system activity and, as a result, can
 *   suspend the IDLE thread before it completes the entire state change
 *   unless interrupts are disabled throughout the state change.
