# Description : method of extracting dump from TARGET device to HOST machine.

DUMPING PROTOCOL :
-----------------

HOST  ------------> TARGET
HOST  <------------ TARGET

1.  TARGET will be waiting for Handshake string from HOST application.
2.  HOST will send handshake string to TARGET.
3.  TARGET will receive handshake string.
4.  TARGET compares the handshake string against the following: -
	RAMDUMP_HANDSHAKE_STRING, if matched, go to step 5
	FSDUMP_HANDSHAKE_STRING, if matched, go to step 19
	TARGET_REBOOT_STRING, if matched, go to step 27
	else, send Negative Acknowledgement 'N', go to step 1
5.  TARGET sends Acknowledgement 'A' to HOST.
6.  TARGET will send 1 byte holding number of memory regions.
7.  HOST will receive 1 byte holding number of memory regions.
8.  TARGET will send 4 bytes holding RAMDUMP start address for all memory regions.
9.  HOST will receive 4 bytes holding RAMDUMP start address for all memory regions.
10.  TARGET will send 4 bytes holding RAMDUMP size for all memory regions.
11. HOST will receive 4 bytes holding RAMDUMP size for all memory regions.
12. TARGET will send 1 byte holding heap index for all memory regions.
13. HOST will receive 1 byte holding heap index for all memory regions.
14. HOST will send 1 byte holding number of memory regions to be dumped by target.
15. TARGET will receive 1 byte holding number of memory regions to be dumped.
16. TARGET will send RAMDUMP size bytes in a loop for each memory region to be dumped.
17. HOST will receive RAMDUMP size bytes in a loop until all "size" bytes received for each memory region to be dumped.
18. goto step 1.
19. TARGET sends Acknowledgement 'A' to HOST.
20. TARGET will send 4 bytes holding starting address of the Userfs region in Flash.
21. HOST will receive 4 bytes holding starting address of the Userfs region in Flash.
22. TARGET will send 4 bytes holding the size of the Userfs partition in Flash.
23. HOST will receive 4 bytes holding the size of the Userfs partition in Flash.
24. TARGET will send FSDUMP size bytes to the HOST.
25. HOST will receive FSDUMP size bytes from the TARGET.
26. goto step 1.
27. TARGET sends Acknowledgement 'A' to HOST.
28. If CONFIG_BOARD_ASSERT_AUTORESET is enabled, the device is reset.
29. The dump function on the TARGET side exits.

Note :
Handshake string for dumping RAM contents is "TIZENRTRMDUMP".
Handshake string for dumping Userfs contents is "TIZENRTFSDUMP".
String for TARGET Reboot is "TIZENRTREBOOT".
